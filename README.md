# Clustering-with-SPSS

This repository contains the analysis and code for a Lawn and Garden (L&G) market segmentation project. The aim of this project is to provide a small L&G firm with a comprehensive understanding of the consumer landscape in the L&G market. This is achieved through clustering and profiling based on various demographic, behavioral, and psychographic variables.

## Project Overview
The project uses a combination of hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering methods to identify the most relevant consumer segments for effective marketing strategies. The primary focus is on understanding consumer behaviors, attitudes, and demographic profiles related to lawn and gardening activities.

### Clustering Variables
- **L&G Knowledge** (Q20)
- **Interest in L&G Activities** (Q21)
- **Attitudes towards L&G Care** (Q22)
- **Reasons for Growing Plants** (Q24)
- **Maintaining a Lawn** (Q26)

### Profiling Variables
- **Age** (Q3)
- **Gender** (Q4)
- **Marital Status** (Q40)
- **Education** (Q41)

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Conversion of all variables to a scaled (continuous) format for consistency in analysis.
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: Utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters, employing Ward’s method.
3. **K-means Clustering**: Applied post hierarchical analysis to fine-tune and optimize the segment partitioning.

### Key Findings
- The analysis identified **5 distinct clusters**.
- **Cluster 5** was identified as the most relevant for the L&G firm, characterized by high levels of engagement and interest in L&G activities.
- Demographic analysis of Cluster 5 revealed a significant presence of married men, around the age of 36, with a bachelor’s degree.

## Target Marketing Strategy
Based on the analysis, the primary marketing strategy is focused on engaging married men in their mid-30s with a bachelor’s degree who show a high interest in L&G activities.
